## Controlling the state

You can easily control the state of the value by binding it to the `value` prop.

You can also change the number of inputs through the `numOfInputs` prop.

<br/>

```js
<script>
	import SvelteOtp from ‘@k4ung/svelte-otp’;

    let value = 'abc12'

</script>

<SvelteOtp numOfInputs={5} bind:value />
```
